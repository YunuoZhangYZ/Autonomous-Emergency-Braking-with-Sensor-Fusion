The final project -- Advanced Emergency Braking with Sensor Fusion technique is contributed by Yunuo Zhang and Jacob Buckelew.

Yunuo: 
For project report, contribute on Sections: Modeling AEB Controller, Modeling Sensors and Environments, Safety Verification, Simulations and Verification. 

Implement the AEB model on Simulink based on provided example in Matlab documentation, (we modified the model by adding safety monitor, and we also modified the model 
	to apply to different driving Scenarios and truncate original useless helper functions)

plot the results and analysis the results
record the video demo
Github instructions and requirements to run the model




Jacob:
